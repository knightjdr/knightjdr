Although formally trained as a molecular biologist, I have been programming since 2000. In 2015 I became a full-time programmer and now work as a bioinformatician at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto, performing analysis and creating web apps that help biologists to understand,
manage and visualize their own data.
